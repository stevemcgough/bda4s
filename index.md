## BDA4S 2021 

### A Workshop at 2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data [(IEEE Big Data 2021)](http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2021/)
December 15th-18th, 2021, Orlando, FL, USA

## Outline

Sustainability is a significant challenge, given the impending consequences of global warming. Computing has its role to play in this environment. Computing can be seen as both part of the problem â€“ with ICT accounting for 1.11Gt of CO2 in 2020 and estimated to more than double by 2030 - but also as part of the solution as we use computational resources to make the world a more sustainable place. Big Data is a key asset in developing a more sustainable environment. Analysis of this data can lead to new breakthroughs and better use of the resources we have.   
This workshop will focus on the cutting-edge developments from both academia and industry, with a particular emphasis on novel techniques to capture, store and process big data from a wide range of sources for improving sustainability, and in particular on the methodologies and technologies which can be applied to correlate, learn and mine, interpret and visualize data which will improve sustainability.   
This workshop is timely and interesting for researchers, academics and practitioners in big data processing and analytics, energy efficiency, sustainability, and Green Computing. The workshop is very relevant to the big data community, especially data mining, machine learning, cyber- physical systems, computational intelligence, and will bring forth a lively forum on this exciting and challenging area at the conference.

* Decision support for computer energy management
* Lifecycle management of computing resources
* Reduction of resource requirements for computational work
* Efficient use of Cloud resources
* Efficient use of local resources
* Comparisons of energy usage of computational equipment
* Estimation of energy consumption
* Evaluation of techniques to reduce consumption

Computing for Sustainability
* Using Big Data Analytics for improving sustainability
* Visualization of sustainability
* Decision support through computer analysis
* Lifecycle management through big data and/or analytics
